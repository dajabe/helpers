# Helpers
This repository is intended to be a collection of helper scripts and functions that I write for myself and others to use.
If you find a script you like in here and have some ideas on how to improve it feel free to submit a PR.

# Scripts
Will aim to keep this list up to date

## tmux
#### `tmux-session-here-h` / `tmux-session-here-v`
These two scripts will launch a new tmux session in your current directory using the directory name as the session name.
This will split into two panes with one a editor session and the other a shell to a specified percentage or line/column number.
Also optionally allows you to specify a environment command to run such as `nvm use`
